Trying it out git.

Hi there,

Everywhere i go to learn something, I see the reference of git being made. I thought i should at least learn the basics of git and what repository and other terms mean. This tutorial is really short and sweet that is put up on the git guide. I am just editing a read me file and then will save and commit the changes. Lets see how it goes from here.

Regards!
